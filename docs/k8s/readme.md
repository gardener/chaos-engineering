# **Module: `k8s`**

## Purpose

### What?

This module provides [`chaostoolkit`](https://chaostoolkit.org) actions to disrupt pods in Kubernetes clusters. It supports:

- **Pods**: *Termination* of pods in one zone with a min/max lifetime (e.g. 0s-0s to shoot down any pod right when it tries to come up or e.g. 10-60s to let them come up at least for 10s but shoot them down at the latest after 60s) with or without a grace period.

You can run the above in parallel, as long as the targeted zones differ. This way you can also test whether you recover after a multi-zonal outage.

This module also provides [`chaostoolkit`](https://chaostoolkit.org) probes:

- **Health Probe**: Probes various Kubernetes cluster functions in parallel:
  - **`api`**: API server availability from outside the cluster (regional sub-probe)
  - **`api-external`**: API server availability from inside the cluster via the LB DNS record (zonal sub-probe)
  - **`api-internal`**: API server availability from inside the cluster via the `kubernetes` cluster service (zonal sub-probe)
  - **`dns-external`**: Resolution of public DNS records from inside the cluster (zonal sub-probe)
  - **`dns-internal`**: Resolution of cluster DNS records from inside the cluster (zonal sub-probe)
  - **`dns-management`**: DNS record update capability from inside the cluster (zonal sub-probe)
  - **`pod-lifecycle`**: Pod scheduling capability into the cluster (zonal sub-probe)
  - **`web-hook`**: Web hook reachability from the API server to the web hooks inside the cluster (regional sub-probe)

### How?

- **Pods**: Based on the given zone and filters, pods are identified busily/continuously and *terminated* with or without a grace period. You may provide a min/max lifetime to make the process more random, chaotic, and unpredictable, which may further help you unearth issues.
- **Health Probe**: Deploys probes into the cluster that busily/continuously probe various Kubernetes cluster functions in parallel. This operation must be rolled back when completed.

### Why?

Implementing high availability that can even tolerate a zone outage unscathed is no trivial task. You can find more information on how to achieve this goal [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/shoot_high_availability_best_practices.md). To put your solution to the test, this module will help you.

The probe on the other hand is targeting Kubernetes provider developers and output-qualification and puts cluster HA as such to the test, which requires automation as Kubernetes clusters may perform many functions in parallel.

## Usage

### Actions and Rollbacks

`chaostoolkit` introduces so-called [actions](https://chaostoolkit.org/reference/api/experiment/#action) that can be composed into [experiments](https://chaostoolkit.org/reference/api/experiment/#experiment) that perform operations against a system (here a Kubernetes cluster). The following actions (and explicit [rollbacks](https://chaostoolkit.org/reference/api/experiment/#rollbacks)) are supported:

Module: [`chaosgarden.k8s.actions`](/chaosgarden/k8s/actions.py)

- `run_pod_failure_simulation`: Run pod failure simulation.
- `run_pod_failure_simulation_in_background`: Same as above, but running in background as a thread. Normally not used with experiments, but directly in Python (scripts).

- `run_cluster_health_probe`: Run cluster health probe (usually only interesting to Kubernetes provider developers).
- `rollback_cluster_health_probe`: Rollback cluster health probe explicitly (usually performed automatically above, but can also be invoked explicitly as rollback step in an experiment to deal with interruptions).
- `run_cluster_health_probe_in_background`: Same as above, but running in background as a thread. Normally not used with experiments, but directly in Python (scripts).

### Pod Selectors

The following pod selectors are supported:

- `pod_node_label_selector`, e.g. `topology.kubernetes.io/zone=world-1a,worker.gardener.cloud/pool=cpu-worker,...`, right-hand side may be a regex, operators are `=|==|!=|=~|!~`
- `pod_label_selector`, e.g. `gardener.cloud/role=controlplane,gardener.cloud/role=vpa,...`, regular [pod label selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors) (not interpreted by `chaosgarden`)
- `pod_metadata_selector`, e.g. `namespace=kube-system,name=kube-apiserver.*,...`, right-hand side may be a regex, operators are `=|==|!=|=~|!~`
- `pod_owner_selector`, e.g. `kind!=DaemonSet,name=kube-apiserver.*,...`, right-hand side may be a regex, operators are `=|==|!=|=~|!~`

### Configuration

No [configuration](https://chaostoolkit.org/reference/api/experiment/#configuration) required.

### Secrets

The following [secret](https://chaostoolkit.org/reference/api/experiment/#secrets) field is optional:

- `kubeconfig_path`: Path to `kubeconfig` file with Kubernetes cluster configuration and credentials

You can omit this field if `$KUBECONFIG` points to your `kubeconfig` file (default).

## Examples

- [Run Pod Failure Simulation](/docs/k8s/run-pod-failure-simulation.json)

- [Run Cluster Health Probe as Hypothesis](/docs/k8s/run-cluster-health-probe-as-hypothesis.json) (doesn't really fit as it must run in background, which is not supported by `chaostoolkit`)
- [Run Cluster Health Probe as Method](/docs/k8s/run-cluster-health-probe-as-method.json) (the better alternative and almost identical in `chaostoolkit` behavior)

- [Explicit Kubernetes Secrets](/docs/k8s/explicit-k8s-secrets.json) (if you do not want to use `$KUBECONFIG`)
